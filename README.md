# Mario-jump
## About the files
These are all different iterations of a singular program I developed in college. All three are a simple, object-oriented principle based platformer featuring mario and a single goomba. The program was originally developed in Java and was later translated to Javascript and Python. The Javascript edition involves basic HTML work as well. The game involves pipe interactions and the ability to throw fireballs into goombas, there is no enemy and player hitbox interaction. 
#### Controls
You may use the left and right keys to move, up or space to jump, and ctrl to throw fireballs which will incinerate goombas. 
## How to Run
### Java
To run the Java version, download the files and run the build.bat file using a pre-downloaded Java. It will immediately run all the files available to it.
### Javascript
Make sure you have all the files downloaded and you may then open the file named "Assignment 7" in your browser of choice to play.
### Python
Make sure you have all the files downloaded and run the game file using python. Pygame will be necessary.
